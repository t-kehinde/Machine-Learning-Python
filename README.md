 This notebook is for IBM Machine Learning with Python project. In this project, supervised machine learning classifiers, KNearest Neighbor, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree and Logistic Regression were evaluated.  The dataset used for the project contains 346 loans with 7 features for the training set and 54 loans for the test set.
